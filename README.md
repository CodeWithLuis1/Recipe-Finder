This project is our first multi-page React application, developed using React Router DOM — the most popular library for building multi-page apps in React. It demonstrates how to structure and navigate between different pages seamlessly while maintaining a clean and scalable architecture.

The state management is powered by Zustand, a lightweight and fast state management library for React. To keep the state organized, the project applies the Slice Pattern, splitting the store into multiple smaller, independent slices. This makes the codebase easier to maintain, extend, and debug as the application grows.

The project is designed to be both a learning resource and a practical template for building robust, maintainable, and scalable React applications. It’s perfect for developers who want to understand how to combine routing with modern, modular state management techniques.
